      <p>Mu is an operating system for Life. It's based on the foundations of more than a decade of work on 
      <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a>, an API first development platform, and related projects.
      </p>

      <p>Today's operating systems were built in an iterative fashion to enable us as humans to complete tasks and 
      do work alone, later augmented by the internet and repurposed for entertainment and a myriad of other social services. 
      Yet none of these were created based on the way in which we live our lives or how we interact with the environment around us.
      </p>

      <p>Mu rethinks the OS from the ground up. Primarily geared towards human interaction through text and speech rather than 
      than point and click. We're building it as a multiplayer first network instead of the old single user model.
      We'll have more to share on how to get involved soon.</p>
