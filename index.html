      <p>Mu is an operating system for Life. It's based on the foundations of almost a decade of work on 
      <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a>, an API first development platform.
      </p>

      <p>Today's operating systems were built in an iterative fashion to enable us as humans to complete tasks and 
      do work, later repurposed for entertainment and a myriad of other social services. Yet none of these were 
      created based on the values by which we live our lives or in a way we interact with the environment around us.
      </p>

      <p>Mu rethinks the OS from the ground up. Primarily geared towards human interaction through text and speech rather 
      than point and click. We're building it as a network first rather than something that just exists on your phone or
      computer. We'll have more to share soon.
