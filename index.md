<div id="abstract">
Mu is a new cloud based operating system built to address many of the problems we 
currently face with the web. The internet has become a walled garden largely because 
of the app ecosystem and incumbent gravitational forces. This plays out both on the 
mobile side and cloud infrastructure. Browsers were meant to solve a lot of this 
problem along with open source. That hasn't turned out as we expected. There's a need
to start a new ecosystem that provides an open alternative to the closed systems of today.
