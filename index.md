<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Micro foundation (Mu) is defining the building blocks of a new networked operating system for real world services.
It's based on more than a decade of work on <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a> - an open source API first development 
platform.
</p>

<p>Today's operating systems were created for humans to complete tasks and do work, later reshaped by the internet and 
repurposed for entertainment and social networks. They were not built based on how we live our lives or the way we 
interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're reimagining an OS from the ground up. Geared towards multiplayer first experiences, interaction through text and 
speech rather than point and click and driven by our values as opposed to consumerism.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
The world is moving towards being driven entirely by technology, shifting our experiences to digital rather than 
physical, where everything is a service. In this new world, we believe there needs to be a model for development and system of interaction for 
these services.
</p>
<p>
In our current world, the global tech incumbents rule our lives.
They benefit from exploiting our actions and deliver addictive services that are impossible to break free from. We have the chance to 
build a new system which removes these exploits and creates a more free, transparent and open economy.
</p>
<p>
The Micro OS will result in the creation of an open, value based, alternative to the existing services and systems 
we know and have come to rely upon.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>
The <a href="/network">Micro Network</a> will create significant liquidity for a number of people, including
those running services. Yet, there is another demographic of people who will not be so privileged and will not be
able to participate directly. For those people, we want to ensure they are also benefitting from our efforts.
</p>

<p>
2.5% of wallet balances in the network will be redistributed yearly to the least privileged by way of charitable donation. 
It will be a wealth tax applied to all.
</p>

<p>
No system that benefits mankind should be created without taking the least privileged into consideration, those without
the ability to participate. We will ensure what's built is not just benefiting the 1% but making a difference to all
through conscious effort.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Potential</h2>
<p>
At a certain point we do not want to command systems but instead have our needs anticipated by something more intelligent.
Intelligence is an emergent behaviour in the universe and the creation of such a system is no different.
</p>
<p>
The singularity is not something that can just be created, it must emerge. Google and others are attempting to develop 
this technology and they have the immense resources to fund that research.
</p>
<p>
There is an opportunity to build the next intelligent system using an emergent model. We can't compete with Google and others directly
but if we take on a crowdsourced approach, using a network, then we have the chance of building a completely open general AI not 
governed by the tech incumbents.
