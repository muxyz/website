<center>Community app platform</center>
<br>
<div id="abstract">
Mu is a new app platform built to address many of the problems we 
face with the web today. The internet has become an addictive and exploitative walled garden because 
of the app ecosystem and tech incumbent profit motivations.

<p>Open source was meant to solve these issues but
that hasn't played out the way we hoped. There's a need
to start from the ground up and build a new system that provides an open alternative
to the existing systems we have today.</p>
<p>
We propose a new community app platform, which focuses on the needs of people, not profits.
