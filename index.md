Mu is a new operating system built to address many of the problems we 
face with the web today. The internet has become a walled garden largely because 
of the app ecosystem and incumbent gravitational forces. This plays out both on the 
mobile side and cloud infrastructure. Browsers were meant to solve a lot of these
problems along with open source. That hasn't turned out to be the case. There's a need
to start from the ground up and build a new system that provides an open alternative
to the closed systems of today.
