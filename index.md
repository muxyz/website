<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today's computing platforms were created for work. Later reshaped by the web
for entertainment, social networking and ads. They were not built based on how we live our
lives or interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're proposing a new platform built from the ground up based on real world experiences, not algorithms or Ads.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
The global tech incumbents rule our lives. They deliver addictive services impossible to break free from.
We have the opportunity to remove these exploits and creates a more open and free platform.
</p>
<p>
Mu will be the basis for this new alternative to the systems and services
we've come to know and rely on.
</p>

<h2>Platform</h2>

<p>Mu will include a set of standalone "micro" apps, then move towards creating marketplace and transaction system enabling people to pay for and access everyday services
in a simple and straight forward manner.
</p> 
<p>
Community begins with it's people, hence our focus on shared experiences. By creating 
a safe and engaging place for communities we can build the foundations for an open and collaborative 
platform in the future.
</p>

<h2>Funding & Governance</h2>
<p>
Donations will be used for the project bootstrapping to align with the community 
and early members. Sponsors will be given
early access to the platform when ready.
</p>
<p>
Mu will be governed by a member based 
community interest company (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company">CIC</a>).
This allows members to come and go
over time but maintain a cohesive structure for the long term. This is in 
contrast to a share based organisation that ultimately has to 
achieve liquidity shareholders.
