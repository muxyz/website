<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Today's platforms were created for humans to do work and complete tasks. Later reshaped by the internet, 
repurposed for entertainment, social networks and advertising. They were not built based on how we live 
our lives or the way we interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're reimagining an operating system from the ground up. Geared towards community first experiences, through messaging
and voice, rather than scroll, point and click. Driven by our shared values, not exploitive and addictive consumerism.
</p>

<p>The outcome is to define a new operating system for the real world and launch an open services network
which anyone can participate in, contribute to or benefit from.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The world is moving towards being driven entirely by technology, shifting our experiences to digital rather than 
physical, where everything is a service. In this new world, we believe there needs to be a model of interaction and system for
development.
</p>
<p>
The global tech incumbents rule our lives.
Benefitting from exploiting our actions and delivering addictive services that are impossible to break free of. We have the chance to 
build a new system which removes these exploits and creates a more free, transparent and open economy.
</p>
<p>
If successful, Mu will be the foundation for this open, value based, alternative to the existing services and systems 
we've come to know and rely upon.

<h2>Economics</h2>

<p>
Our <a href="/network">Network</a> will create significant financial liquidity for a number of people, however, there is another 
demographic who will not be so privileged. For those people, we want to ensure they are also benefitting from our efforts.
</p>

<p>
2.5% of token holdings in the network will be redistributed yearly to the least privileged by way of charitable donation. 
It will be a wealth tax applied to all.
</p>

<p>
No system that benefits mankind should be created without taking the least privileged into consideration. We will ensure what's 
built is not just benefiting the 1% but making a difference to all through conscious effort.
</p>

<h2>Intelligence</h2>
<p>
At a certain point we do not want to command systems but instead have our needs anticipated by something more intelligent.
Intelligence is an emergent property in the universe and the creation of such a system is no different.
</p>
<p>
AGI (artificial general intelligence) is not something that can just be manifest from nothing. It requires immense power, 
research and development, which only the likes of Google are capable of doing. 
</p>
<p>
We have the opportunity to build the next system of intelligence using an emergent model. Crowdsourcing our own power
and development, we can create an open AGI not governed by the tech incumbents.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
  <p>
  Mu is powered by the open source platform <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a>.

<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>
The Mu operating system and network will be governed by a member based 
community interest company (CIC). This will allow members to come and go
over time but maintain a cohesive structure for the long term. This is in 
contrast to a share based organisation that ultimately has to 
achieve some form of liquidity shareholders.
</p>
<p>
Mu will operate much like the Linux foundation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
Mu as a piece of software will need to be combined with hardware. Initially this may be 
run on laptops or cloud based computers but over time we imagine a small device
that stays with you or lives in your home. The vast majority of time we're either on 
the move or at home and so Mu should be with you then.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>
We plan to take a crowdfunding approach for Mu to be squarely aligned with the community 
and initial adopters. As keeping with the governance plans, initial donations may 
be used as a path to membership or early access. 
</p>
<p>Funding plans will be announced soon.</p>
