Mu is a new human computer interface built to address many of the problems we 
face with the web today. The internet has become a walled garden largely because 
of the app ecosystem and incumbent gravitational forces. This plays out both on
mobile and cloud too. Open source was meant to solve these issues but
that hasn't turned out to be the case. There's a need
to start from the ground up and build a new system that provides an open alternative
to the closed systems of today.
