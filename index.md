<div id="blurb">
<p>The Micro foundation (Mu) is defining the building blocks of a new operating system for the real world. It's 
based on more than a decade of work on the open source project <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a>.
</p>

<p>Today's operating systems were built to enable humans to complete tasks and 
do work, later reshaped by the internet and repurposed for entertainment and social services. 
Yet none of this was created based on the way we live our lives or interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're reimagining the OS from the ground up. Geared towards interaction through text and speech rather 
than point and click, driven by values, and designed as a multiplayer first experience instead of the single 
player modes we've come to know.
</p>

<p>We'll have more to share soon.</p>
