Mu is a new cloud based operating system.
It's built to address many of the problems we 
currently face with the cloud. 
The internet has become a walled garden largely because 
of the app ecosystem and incumbent gravitational forces. 
This plays out both on the mobile side and cloud infrastructure.
Browsers were meant to solve a lot of this problem along with 
open source. That hasn't turned out as we expected. There's a need
to start a new ecosystem that provides an open alternative 
to the closed systems of today.
