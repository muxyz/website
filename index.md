<center>Community app platform</center>
<br>
<div id="abstract">
Mu is a new app platform built to address the problems we face with the web today. The internet has become an addictive and exploitive walled garden 
driven by social media and tech giant profit motivations.

<p>Open source was meant to solve these issues but that hasn't played out the way we hoped. There's a need
to start again and build an open alternative to the systems we have today.</p>
<p>
We propose a new community app platform, which focuses on the needs of people by stripping away the noise and putting control back into the hands of developers.
