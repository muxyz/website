<div id="blurb">
<p>Mu is the foundational building block for a new operating system for the real world, based on more than a decade of work 
on the open source project <a href="/micro">Micro</a>.
</p>

<p>Today's operating systems were built in an iterative fashion to enable humans to complete tasks and 
do work, later reshaped by the internet and repurposed for entertainment and social services. 
Yet none of this was created based on the way we live our lives or interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're reimagining the OS from the ground up. Geared towards interaction through text and speech rather 
than point and click. Driven by values, and built as a multiplayer first experience instead of the old 
single user modes we've come to know.
</p>
<p>We'll have more to share soon.</p>
