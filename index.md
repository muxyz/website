title: "Mu: An Operating System for Life"
---

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Today's operating systems were created for humans to complete tasks and do work, later reshaped by the internet, 
repurposed for entertainment, advertising and social networks. They were not built based on the way we live our lives 
or how we interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're reimagining an OS from the ground up. Geared towards multiplayer first experiences through messaging
and voice rather than single user mode point and click. Driven by values, not exploitive consumerism.
</p>

<p>The outcome is to define the building blocks of a new operating system for the real world and launch an open services economy
which anyone can participate in, contribute to or benefit from.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The world is moving towards being driven entirely by technology, shifting our experiences to digital rather than 
physical, where everything is a service. In this new world, we believe there needs to be a model for development and system of interaction for 
these services.
</p>
<p>
In our current world, the global tech incumbents rule our lives.
They benefit from exploiting our actions and deliver addictive services that are impossible to break free from. We have the chance to 
build a new system which removes these exploits and creates a more free, transparent and open services economy.
</p>
<p>
If successful, Mu will be the foundation for this open, value based, alternative to the existing services and systems 
we've come to know and rely upon.

<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>
Our <a href="/network">Network</a> will create significant financial liquidity for a number of people, however, there is another 
demographic who will not be so privileged. For those people, we want to ensure they are also benefitting from our efforts.
</p>

<p>
2.5% of token holdings in the network will be redistributed yearly to the least privileged by way of charitable donation. 
It will be a wealth tax applied to all.
</p>

<p>
No system that benefits mankind should be created without taking the least privileged into consideration. We will ensure what's 
built is not just benefiting the 1% but making a difference to all through conscious effort.
</p>

<h2>Potential</h2>
<p>
At a certain point we do not want to command systems but instead have our needs anticipated by something more intelligent.
Intelligence is an emergent property in the universe and the creation of such a system is no different.
</p>
<p>
The singularity is not something that can just be manifest from nothing. It requires immense power, research and development, 
which only the likes of Google are capable of doing.
</p>
<p>
There is an opportunity for us to build the next system of intelligence using an emergent model. Crowdsourcing our own power
and development, we can build an open general AI not governed by the tech incumbents.
