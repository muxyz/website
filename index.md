<div id="blurb">
<p>The Micro foundation (Mu) is defining the building blocks of a new operating system for real world services. 
It's based on more than a decade of work on the open source project <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a>.
</p>

<p>Today's operating systems were built to enable humans to complete tasks and 
do work, later reshaped by the internet and repurposed for entertainment and social services. 
Yet none of this was created based on the way we live our lives or interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're reimagining the OS from the ground up. Geared towards interaction through text and speech rather 
than point and click, driven by values, and designed as a multiplayer first experience instead of the single 
player modes we've come to know.
</p>

## Motivation

<div id="blurb">
<p>
The world is moving towards being driven entirely by technology. Part of that move involves shifting our experiences to digital rather than 
physical services. In a world where everything is a service, we imagine there needs to be a system for interaction and model of development for 
these services. What's more, there's an opportunity to provide an economic incentive to every human being to participate and benefit from 
such a network.
</p>
<p>
In our current world, the few dominate the many. The term FANG, has come to reference the global tech incumbents that rule our lives, our 
digital footprint and more. They benefit financially from all our actions and deliver addictive systems that are impossible to break 
free of. We have a chance to build a system in which these behaviours are removed, where the morals and ethics are coded into systems which 
are openly and transparently available for all to see and use.
