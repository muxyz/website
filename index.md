title: MuOS - An Operating System for Life
---

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Micro foundation (Mu) is defining the building blocks of a new networked operating system for real world services.
It's based on more than a decade of work on the <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a> platform - an open source API first
development runtime.
</p>

<p>Today's operating systems were created for humans to complete tasks and do work, later reshaped by the internet and 
repurposed for entertainment and social networks. They were not built based around the way we live our lives or interact with people
and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're reimagining an OS from the ground up. Geared towards multiplayer first experiences through messaging
and voice rather than singler user mode point and click. Driven by values, not exploitive consumerism.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
The world is moving towards being driven entirely by technology, shifting our experiences to digital rather than 
physical, where everything is a service. In this new world, we believe there needs to be a model for development and system of interaction for 
these services.
</p>
<p>
In our current world, the global tech incumbents rule our lives.
They benefit from exploiting our actions and deliver addictive services that are impossible to break free from. We have the chance to 
build a new system which removes these exploits and creates a more free, transparent and open economy.
</p>
<p>
The Micro OS will result in the creation of an open, value based, alternative to the existing services and systems 
we know and have come to rely upon.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>
The <a href="/network">Micro Network</a> will create significant financial liquidity for a number of people, however, there is another 
demographic who will not be so privileged. For those people, we want to ensure they are also benefitting from our efforts.
</p>

<p>
2.5% of token holdings in the network will be redistributed yearly to the least privileged by way of charitable donation. 
It will be a wealth tax applied to all.
</p>

<p>
No system that benefits mankind should be created without taking the least privileged into consideration, those without
the ability to participate. We will ensure what's built is not just benefiting the 1% but making a difference to all
through conscious effort.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Potential</h2>
<p>
At a certain point we do not want to command systems but instead have our needs anticipated by something more intelligent.
Intelligence is an emergent property in the universe and the creation of such a system is no different.
</p>
<p>
The singularity is not something that can just be manifest from nothing. It requires immense power, research and development, 
which only the likes of Google are capable of doing.
</p>
<p>
There is an opportunity for us to build the next system of intelligence using an emergent model. Crowdsourcing our own power
and development, we can potentially build an open general AI not governed by the tech incumbents.
