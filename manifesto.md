<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Today's platforms were created for work. Later reshaped by the internet
for entertainment, social networks and advertising. They were not built based on how we live our
lives, interact with people or the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're proposing a new platform built from the ground up, geared towards community first experiences using messaging and voice, rather than point and click. Driven by our shared values, not exploitive consumerism.
</p>

<p>The goal is to create a real world community platform and launch an open network of services 
which anyone can make use of or contribute to.
</p>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The world is moving towards being driven entirely by technology, shifting our experiences to digital rather than 
physical, where everything is a service. In this new world, we believe there needs to be a model of interaction and system for
development.
</p>
<p>
The global tech incumbents rule our lives.
Exploiting our actions and delivering addictive services that are impossible to break free from.
We
have the opportunity to 
build a new system which removes these exploits and creates a more free, transparent and open world.
</p>
<p>
If successful, Mu will be the foundation for this open, value based, alternative to the existing services and systems 
we've come to know and rely upon.

<h2>Finance</h2>

<p>
Our <a href="/network">Network</a> will create significant value for it's participants, however there is another 
demographic who will not be so privileged. For those people, we want to ensure they are also benefitting from our efforts.
</p>

<p>
2.5% of cash holdings in the network will be redistributed yearly to the least privileged by way of charitable donation.
</p>

<p>
No system of benefit should be created without taking the least privileged into consideration. We will ensure what's 
built is not just benefiting the 1%.
</p>

<h2>Intelligence</h2>
<p>
At a certain point we do not want to command systems but instead have our needs anticipated by something more intelligent.
Intelligence is an emergent property in the universe and the creation of such a system is no different.
</p>
<p>
AGI (artificial general intelligence) is not something that can just be manifest from nothing. It requires immense power, 
research and development, which only the likes of Google are capable of doing. 
</p>
<p>
We have the opportunity to build the next system of intelligence using an emergent model. Crowdsourcing our own power
and development, we can create an open AGI not governed by the tech incumbents.
</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
  <p>
  Mu will be powered by the open source platform <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a>. 
  On top of this, We'll introduce a new interface, app and networking model to service 
  the end user.

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>
Who gets to decide how we live our lives or how an AI should behave? Who deems 
what is right for consumption and what is not? We need an agreed upon code of 
ethics, morals and values that governs the overall system. To decide what we 
accept as a service or what is rejected. Part of this will be derived by the 
initial members and the overall community's belief system. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>
The Mu platform and network will be governed by a member based 
community interest company (CIC). This will allow members to come and go
over time but maintain a cohesive structure for the long term. This is in 
contrast to a share based organisation that ultimately has to 
achieve some form of liquidity shareholders.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
Mu as a piece of software will need to be combined with hardware. Initially this may be 
run on a laptop or cloud infrastructure.
</p>
<p>The cost to run 
Mu should be no more than a monthly subscription for common services like an internet 
connection.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>
We plan to take a crowdfunding approach for Mu to be squarely aligned with the community 
and initial adopters. As keeping with the governance plans, initial donations may 
be used as a path to membership or early access. 
</p>
<p>It's not yet clear what the cost structure will be for the project  but likely the 
majority will be spent on building the initial team who will deliver the MVP for the network.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Mu is a real world community platform we're proposing, driven by messaging and  voice. Our goal is to create an 
open alternative to existing platforms that is community driven and accessible to 
all.
