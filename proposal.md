<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today's computing platforms were created for work. Later reshaped by the internet
for entertainment, social networks and advertising. They were not built based on how we live our
lives or the way we interact with people and the world around us.
</p>

<p>We're proposing a new app platform built from the ground up based on group first experiences 
using text based messaging and voice interfaces rather than addictive feed scrolling and point and click UIs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
The global tech incumbents rule our lives.
They deliver addictive services that are impossible to break free from.
We
have the opportunity to 
build a new system which removes these exploits and creates a more free and open technology platform.
</p>
<p>
If successful, Mu will become the foundation for this new open, community based, alternative to the existing services and systems 
we've come to know and rely upon in the past decades.

<h2>Platform</h2>

<p>Mu will include a set of standalone apps starting with Chat, then later move towards creating a
network and transaction system which will enable people to pay for and access everyday services
in a simple and straight forward manner.
</p> 
<p>
Community begins with it's people, hence our focus on Chat to start. By creating 
a safe and engaging place for communities we can build the foundations for an open and collaborative 
platform in the future.
</p>
<p>
A demo chat app can be viewed at <a href="https://micro.mu">Micro.mu</a>.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
  <p>
  Mu will be powered by the open source project <a href="https://micro.dev">Micro</a>. 
  On top of this, We'll introduce a new app, interface and networking model to service 
  the end user.

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>
Who gets to decide how we live our lives or how we interact with technology? Who deems 
what is right for consumption and what is not? We need an agreed upon code of 
ethics, morals and values that governs the overall system. To decide what we 
accept as a service or what is rejected. Part of this will be driven by
the initial members of the community.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>
The Mu platform and network will be governed by a member based 
community interest company (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company">CIC</a>).
This will allow members to come and go
over time but maintain a cohesive structure for the long term. This is in 
contrast to a share based organisation that ultimately has to 
achieve some form of liquidity shareholders.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>
We will plan to crowdfund for the initial project bootstrapping to align with the community 
and early members. As keeping with the governance plans, donations will
be used give first users access.
</p>
</div>

<div id="blurb">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Mu is a new community first app platform we're proposing, driven by messaging and  voice. Our goal is to create an 
open alternative to existing platforms that is community driven and free from exploitation.
