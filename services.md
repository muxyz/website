Real world Micro services

## Overview

Micro services provide the fundamental building blocks for any products, apps or service. They can be used in isolation 
or combined to create powerful distributed systems. The services are intended to be consumed by each other using RPC 
and from the external world through the Micro API. All services are built as open source software.
